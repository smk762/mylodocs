Notary nodes are servers dedicated to performing critical tasks for the Komodo ecosystem.

* **Security** — perform delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) notarizations to provide Bitcoin-level security 
* **Interoperability** — notarize data throughout the ecosystem to allow cross-chain communication
* **Decentralization** — run a full node for each blockchain in the ecosystem to increase each network’s distribution

There are a total of 64 notary nodes in Komodo’s globally-distributed network.

* 60 Nodes are voted in by the Komodo community
* 4 nodes reserved for Komodo Dev Team for testing purposes

The notary node network is divided into 4 regions: 

* North America (NA)
* Europe (EU)
* Asia-Russia (AR)
* Southern Hemisphere (SH)

To promote decentralization, each of the 4 regions contains 15 notary nodes.
